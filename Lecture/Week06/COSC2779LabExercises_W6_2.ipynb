You either use the pretrained model as is or use transfer learning to customize this model to a given task.\n","\n","In this tutorial, you will try two ways to customize a pretrained model:\n","\n","- Feature Extraction: Use the representations learned by a previous network to extract meaningful features from new samples. You simply add a new classifier, which will be trained from scratch, on top of the pretrained model so that you can repurpose the feature maps learned previously for the dataset.\n","\n","\n","- Fine-Tuning: Unfreeze a few of the top layers of a frozen model base and jointly train both the newly-added classifier layers and the last layers of the base model.
