They compute vector-space representations of natural language that are suitable for use in deep learning models. The BERT family of models uses the Transformer encoder architecture to process each token of input text in the full context of all tokens before and after, hence the name: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.\n","\n","BERT models are usually pre-trained on a large corpus of text, then fine-tuned for specific tasks. To learn more about BERT please read the tutorial: \n","- [A Visual Guide to Using BERT for the First Time](https://jalammar.github.io/a-visual-guide-to-using-bert-for-the-first-time/)\n","- [The Illustrated BERT, ELMo, and co. (How NLP Cracked Transfer Learning)](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/)\n","- [The Illustrated Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)\n","\n","\n","## Selecting the BERT model\n","Here you can choose which BERT model you will load from TensorFlow Hub and fine-tune. There are multiple BERT models available.\n","\n","- BERT-Base, Uncased and seven more models with trained weights released by the original BERT authors.\n","- Small BERTs have the same general architecture but fewer and/or smaller Transformer blocks, which lets you explore tradeoffs between speed, size and quality.\n","- ALBERT: four different sizes of \"A Lite BERT\" that reduces model size (but not computation time) by sharing parameters between layers.\n","- BERT Experts: eight models that all have the BERT-base architecture but offer a choice between different pre-training domains, to align more closely with the target task.\n","- Electra has the same architecture as BERT (in three different sizes), but gets pre-trained as a discriminator in a set-up that resembles a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).\n","- BERT with Talking-Heads Attention and Gated GELU [base, large] has two improvements to the core of the Transformer architecture.\n","\n","The model documentation on TensorFlow Hub has more details and references to the research literature. Follow the links above, or click on the tfhub.dev URL printed after the next cell execution.\n","\n","The suggestion is to start with a Small BERT (with fewer parameters) since they are faster to fine-tune. If you like a small model but with higher accuracy, ALBERT might be your next option. If you want even better accuracy, choose one of the classic BERT sizes or their recent refinements like Electra, Talking Heads, or a BERT Expert.\n","\n","Aside from the models available below, there are multiple versions of the models that are larger and can yield even better accuracy, but they are too big to be fine-tuned on a single GPU. You will be able to do that on the Solve GLUE tasks using BERT on a TPU colab.\n","\n","You'll see in the code below that switching the tfhub.dev URL is enough to try any of these models, because all
